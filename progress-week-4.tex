\section{Introduction}
I have spent the majority of my time this week learning CS231n\cite{cs231n} by Stanford University and try implementing a Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of CIFAR10 dataset.

\section{CS231n}
Until now, I finished 7 lectures below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction
\item Image Classification pipeline
\item Loss Functions and Optimization
\item Backpropagation and Neural Networks
\item Convolutional Neural Networks
\item Training Neural Networks I
\item Training Neural Networks II
\end{enumerate}

All taken notes could be found here: \href{https://gitlab.com/tlvu2697/stanford--cs231n--visual-recognition}{GitLab}


\section{Image Classification using CIFAR10}
\subsection{CIFAR10 with AlexNet}
I first tried CIFAR10\cite{cifar} with AlexNet on PyTorch. The source code could be found \href{https://gitlab.com/tlvu2697/image-classification-cifar10/blob/master/cifar10-classification-alexnet.py}{here}. But there were 2 problems, I did not know how to resize the input images to fit AlexNet's input requirement without using pytorch's DataLoader (from 32x32 to 224x224). But the training performance when using DataLoader was so poor. So it took me too much time to do anything. Finally I decided to drop it and started developing my own CNN architecture to work with CIFAR10.

\subsubsection{Result}
With batch\_size of 100, number of epochs of 100, learning\_rate of 1e-2; we have the train accuracy of 100\% (50000 / 50000) and the test error of 28.37\% (2837 / 10000).

All my work and trained model could be found \href{https://gitlab.com/tlvu2697/image-classification-cifar10}{here}.

\subsubsection{Problems}
The best test error I could retrieve was 28.37\%, how do I reduce that number? And what cause that error, my Network architecture or my hyper-parameters?
